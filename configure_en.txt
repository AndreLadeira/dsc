These are the instructions to download and build the applications of this project.
These instructions cover the process to build them as they were created, using the
Qt Creator suite of tools.

The code in this project was all written in plain standard c++. No additional libraries
are needed nor any OS specific feature was used.

To build this project using Qt proceed as follows:

1 - Create a folder for the project

2 - Open a Terminal window, change the current directory to the project’s directory

3 - At the project folder run: git clone https://github.com/AndreLadeira/dsc

4 - Open Qt Creator, then File -> Open Project and choose one of the master
    ".pro" files, located at the project's root directory. The master files are:

    /dsc/greedy.pro:

        Opens the standalone random-restart greedy algorithm to solve the atsp problem.
        The command line parameters are:
        <tsplib file name> <#of restarts> <attempts per restart> <mask size>

    /dsc/bet.pro

        The bet algorithm to solve the atsp problem.

5-  Follow the instructions of the Qt project loader to choose a kit to build your project.
    You must have a kit capable of building terminal applications installed as part of your
    Qt installation in order to build the apps of this project.

6 - At the Qt Creator IDE, Righ-click the project folder then choose "Build".
    The project's executable will be put at

    ~dsc/ATSP/algorithms/build-<project>-<kit>-Debug or -Release

    where <project> is the project name and <kit> is the name of
    the particular kit chosen to built it.

Notes:

The .pro files referenced here are of a special kind known as "template: subdirs" files
within the Qt documentation. These files are used to build more complex projects, where,
for example, an application is built using libraries that are also part of the project.

The template:subdirs .pro file automate and organize the process of loading all the
necessary components (other .pro files) and compiling/building the project the in the
correct order, considering the dependencies.

The current components of this projects are described below:

base:

    basic stuff, nom atsp related. For example, a faster and simpler random number
    generator.

atsp_base:

    basic stuff of the atsp problem, not related to a particular way of solving it.

TSPLibLoader:

    a class to load atsp data from tsplib instances. tsplib instances were obtained at

    https://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/comopt/software/TSPLIB95/atsp/

greedy:

    An implementation of a greedy algorithm to solve the atsp problem.
    The greedy algorithm is used both to create a standalone application
    and as part of the betting algorithm.

betting:

    The betting algorithm itself.

Additional Note:

    All projects have a main.cpp file. This purpose of those “mains” were test/debug
    the components. They're not part of any application anymore.
